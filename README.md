# ET-Pfam: Ensemble transfer learning for protein family prediction

> ### performance_analysis branch
> This branch introduces performance analysis features by adding a ResourceMonitor class to track time and memory usage during model training and testing. The ResourceMonitor is integrated into the base and ensemble model scripts, with updates to the training function and requirements file.

This repository contains the data and source code for the manuscript *ET-Pfam: Ensemble transfer learning for protein family prediction*, by S. Escudero, S. A. Duarte, R. Vitale, E. Fenoy, L.A. Bugnon, D.H. Milone and G. Stegmayer, 2025. Research Institute for Signals, Systems and Computational Intelligence, [sinc(i)](https://sinc.unl.edu.ar/).

ET-Pfam is a novel approach based on ensembles of deep learning classifiers trained with transfer learning to predict functional families in the Pfam database. 

## 1. Environment setup

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/sinc-lab/ET-Pfam
cd ET-Pfam
```

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies, such as conda or venv. For example, using conda:

```
conda create -n ET-Pfam python=3.11
conda activate ET-Pfam
```

Once the environment is activated, install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The following 3 sections provide instructions for using a reduced dataset (the *mini dataset*), as it allows quick testing and replication of the main results with significantly lower time and computational costs. The last section summarises the same steps but using the full dataset.

## 2. Test ET-Pfam ensembles

To reproduce the ensemble evaluation presented in the manuscript using pre-trained base models, you will be guided to download the test set embeddings, the trained base models and the ensemble weights (per model and per family).

### 2.1 Download test embeddings

The test embeddings are available in the compressed file [`mini_test.tar.gz`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B0T5C8XiVheYTw6IEFAf3LOFsupzPLVs/view?usp=drive_link). You must download it and place it in a local directory called `data/embeddings/` inside the local repository directory `ET-Pfam`. Run the following commands:

```
mkdir -vp data/embeddings/ 
gdown 1B0T5C8XiVheYTw6IEFAf3LOFsupzPLVs --output data/mini_test.tar.gz
tar -xzf data/mini_test.tar.gz -C data/embeddings/
```

This will create the directory, download the data, and extract the embeddings. Note that the download and extraction may take a few minutes.

### 2.2 Download trained base models and ensemble weights

The file [`mini.tar.gz`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SFOHaZy7NtXohyqdT3-LIvH5sC67WyMy/view?usp=drive_link) contains both the trained base models and the ensemble weights. To download the entire folder use:

```
mkdir -vp models/
gdown 1SFOHaZy7NtXohyqdT3-LIvH5sC67WyMy --output models/mini.tar.gz
tar -xzf models/mini.tar.gz -C models/
```

This will create the local directory `models/mini/` with all the required files.

### 2.3 Run ensemble evaluation

Once all the files are in place, you can run the ensemble using all the strategies evaluated in the paper:

```
python3 test_ensemble.py -v all -m models/mini/
```

All the models inside the directory `models/mini/` will be automatically detected and ensembled. Note that this process, with all strategies evaluations, may take approximately up to 10 hours to complete on a single GPU. The directory `results/mini/` will contain subdirectories with the ensemble results for each individual strategy. To quickly inspect the results:

```
cat results/mini/ensemble_metrics.csv
```

## 3. Train ET-Pfam ensembles

To obtain the ensemble weights for the pre-trained base models downloaded in the previous section, you need to fit the ensemble using the development (dev) partition. Before running the training, you will be guided to download both the trained base models and the test embeddings, provided earlier.  

### 3.1 Download dev embeddings

The dev embeddings are available in a compressed file named [`mini_dev.tar.gz`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15pHIO7J2awgwkgHR5d4MhK2mt4JC1j54/view?usp=drive_link), located in the provided [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p54V_g4iy-XGjzi0C7LGQP9brb9QnL1k?usp=sharing). To download and extract the data, run the following commands from the repository root: 

```
gdown 15pHIO7J2awgwkgHR5d4MhK2mt4JC1j54 --output data/mini_dev.tar.gz
tar -xzf data/mini_dev.tar.gz -C data/embeddings/
```

### 3.2 Run the script for ensemble training

To train the ensemble weights, run the following command:

```
python3 train_ensemble.py -v all -m models/mini/
```

> [!NOTE]
> This training process may take several hours on a single GPU.
> 
After training, the files of trained ensemble weights will be stored in the directory `models/mini/`.
To test these newly trained ensemble models, follow the steps described in Section 2.3.


## 4. Train base models

### 4.1. Download train embeddings

If you want to train your own base models, you first need to download the training embeddings. These are in the file [`mini_train.tar.gz`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12-NZPjjeiAKqp4A8gQ9KfIpSzuBawdMp/view?usp=drive_link) inside the provided Drive folder. You can obtain them running the following commands from the repository root:

```
gdown 12-NZPjjeiAKqp4A8gQ9KfIpSzuBawdMp --output data/mini_train.tar.gz
tar -xzf data/mini_train.tar.gz -C data/embeddings/
```

### 4.2 Run the script for base model training

Once all embeddings are available, you can train a base model by running:

```
python3 train_basemodel.py -o models/mini/<model_name>
```

Replace `<model_name>` with any name you prefer for your experiment. Inside the specified output directory, you will find the trained model weights saved as `weights.pk`, logs and metrics in the file `train_summary.csv`, a copy of the config file used in config.json, and the results for both centered and sliding window tests.

By default, running the training script will train the base models using the settings defined in `config/base.json`. If you want to change hyperparameters, you can edit this JSON file before training.  Inside the json file, you can modify hyperparameters like the window length (`window_len`), learning rate (`lr`) batch size (`batch_size`), and more. After saving your changes, run the training script as shown in the previous step. 

To test this base model, you can run:

```
python3 test_basemodel.py -o models/mini/<model_name>
```

Replace `<model_name>` with the name of the trained model you want to evaluate. The results will be saved in the provided output path.


## 5. Reproduce results with full Pfam dataset

You can also reproduce the results from the manuscript using the full Pfam dataset. Note that his process is significantly slower due to the large size of the dataset. 


### 5.1. Test ET-Pfam ensembles

First, download the required dataset files from the Drive folder and place them into `data/full/` in your local repository. You can download them directly using:

```
gdown --folder 18bD2q-iL2MZE2ddH_-jRp_VDZXoZG8QP --output data/
```

Next, you need to download the test embeddings from the Drive folder located in [`full_test.tar.gz`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HFsSCg-z7NqKwdMfxgj8y1-Ux1X7zJnJ/view?usp=drive_link), the trained base models and the ensemble weights for the full dataset. From the repository root, run:

```
gdown 1HFsSCg-z7NqKwdMfxgj8y1-Ux1X7zJnJ --output data/full_test.tar.gz
tar -xzf data/full_test.tar.gz -C data/embeddings/
gdown 179qTQ-1akdUIkdfjcrxo5X1OOLvEboMl --output models/full.tar.gz
tar -xzf models/full.tar.gz -C models/
```

Once all the files are in place, set the `dataset` field to `full`, of  `config/base.json` to indicate you are working with the full Pfam data instead of the mini version:
```
sed -i 's/mini/full/g' config/base.json
```

Then you can run the ensemble using all voting strategies evaluated in the manuscript:

```
python3 test_ensemble.py -v all -m models/full/
```

This will reproduce the results for the full Pfam dataset, as reported in the paper. To verify the results:
```
cat results/full/ensemble_metrics.csv
```

### 5.2. Train ET-Pfam ensembles

To compute ensemble weights for the full Pfam base models, you need the dev embeddings [`full_dev.tar.gz`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRJjLYgzNWwWLHZcZa5oTKiWAEX3cyHn/view?usp=drive_link)  and extract them as follows:

```
gdown 1kRJjLYgzNWwWLHZcZa5oTKiWAEX3cyHn --output data/full_dev.tar.gz
tar -xzf data/full_dev.tar.gz -C data/embeddings/
```

Then run the ensemble training script with:

```
python3 train_ensemble.py -v all -m models/full/
```

### 5.3. Train base models

To train base models from scratch, first download the training embeddings. Since the dataset is very large, the files are split into multiple zip archives. You can download them directly from the [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pUmkAVIzvb03QwVW6yQm085bRl75ba_9?usp=drive_link).

Once all parts are downloaded, place them inside `data/full_train/` and then run:

```
cat data/full_train/* > data/full_train.tar.gz
tar -xzf data/full_train.tar.gz -C data/embeddings/
```
This will concatenate the parts into a single archive and extract the embeddings into the `data/embeddings/` folder.

The training script can be executed as follows:

```
python3 train_basemodel.py -o models/full/<model_name>/
```

Replace `<model_name>` with any name of your choice for the experiment.
